As the header says this site is an analysis of the game CK3, done as a way of showcasing my own learning of technical tools.
Now why I am going in to so much depth on a topic so frivolous, well mostly for the fun of it, frivolousness is a big part of the game, as even the patch notes of the express:

I am however not a web develop and my webpage making skills are not... good, so navigation on the site is done via links and nothing here is pretty.

**Navigation**
Here on the frontpage you will find links to the two main branches of the site:

A <a href="/Analysis.md">Analysis</a> for the CK3 fan that simply wants to see where I am taking this project and second:

A <a href="/Explainer_notebook.md">Explainer notebook</a> for the more technically inclined showing how I made it. 

If you simply want to play with my interactive maps or download the datasets yourself the following page is for you:

<a href="/Code, Tools and Maps.md">Code, Tools and Maps</a>
