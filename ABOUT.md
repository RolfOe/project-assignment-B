**Project assignment B for Social Graphs**

While this project is about the videogame Crusader Kings 3 (CK3), it is more so a showcase of tools tought in the university course Social Graphs at DTU.
Therefore is must be remembered that tihs project is more of a techinal showcase of tools, then a study in medival politics.
Any additon of political theory is there to give context and spice to the datamanipulation and calculations, and should not be taken as valid facts.
This is espicially true when comparing the language use of modern wikipedia articles, to historical areas of strife and contestation. 
While the method of comparing language use to historical regions may one day be developed into something, this project is not nearly refined wnough to give vaild accounts.

This being said i hope you enjoy the tour.
