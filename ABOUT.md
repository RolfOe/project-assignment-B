As the header says this site is an analysis of the game CK3, done as a way of showcasing my own learning of technical tools.
Now why I am going in to so much depth on a topic so frivolous, well mostly for the fun of it, frivolousness is a big part of the game, as even the patch notes of the express:

[entire patchnotes CK3 patch 1.2](https://www.crusaderkings.com/en/news/dev-diary-45-1-2-patch-notes?utm_source=stcom-owned&utm_medium=social-owned&utm_content=post&utm_campaign=crki3_ck_20201123_cawe_dd)


I am however not a web develop and my webpage making skills are not... good, so navigation on the site is done via links and nothing here is pretty.

**navitagtion**
Here on the frontpage you will find links to the two main branches of the site: An [analysis](https://rolfoe.github.io/project-assignment-B/analysis.md) for the CK3 fan that simply wants to see where I am taking this project and second an [explainer notebook](https://rolfoe.github.io/project-assignment-B/Explainer_notebook.md) for the more technically inclined showing how I made it. 

if you simply want to play with my interactive maps or download the datasets yourself the follong page is for you 




**this site gives a short introduction but mainly serves as a techinal overvier on how the material here was produced**
